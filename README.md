## Rules

- Player 1 starts the game with both players initially at zero.
- Each player rolls the dice and their scores go up.
- First player to reach 50 points wins the game.

**Catch**:

- Dice rolling is switched to the other player if the current player rolls up a 1 on dice.
- On rolling 1 the current rolls turn sum score becomes zero.
- To keep the current rolls sum score and add that up into his total score, current player can press hold and pass dice roll to the other player.
